## About

Simple module that parses a given JSON file. At the moment it only supports async, but I plan on expanding it to not only support async + sync for local JSON, but HTTP requests and maybe even streams (much like twitter's) for remote JSON :)


## Install

You can install this through npm:

    $ npm install json-parse
